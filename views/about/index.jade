            dt Where does it come from?
            dd.
              The wait time data comes directly from both restaurants and diners. When we receive data directly from a restaurant, we'll show that and let you know that it's "verified" by the restaurant. If we don't have that information, we take all your votes and show you the average.
            dt How to vote
            dd.
              If you'd like to cast your vote, pull up the homepage, find the restaurant you'd like to vote on and click on the button that best describes the wait time. You can choose between four wait times: None (No Wait), Short (15-30min), Long (30-60min), or Full (Not Seating).
